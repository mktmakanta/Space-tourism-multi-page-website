# Space Tourism Website

![Space Tourism Website](./space-tourism.jpg)

This project is a multi-page space tourism website built as part of a challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The goal was to build a website that closely matches the provided design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also did my best to make it as responsible as possible and added some hover and active state effects.
